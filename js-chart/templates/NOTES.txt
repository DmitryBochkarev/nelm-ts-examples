Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

This chart demonstrates JavaScript-based chart rendering in Nelm!

The following resources have been created:
  - Deployment: {{ .Release.Name }}-web ({{ .Values.replicaCount }} replicas)
  - Service: {{ .Release.Name }}-web ({{ .Values.service.type }})

To learn more about the chart, see the README.md file.

Note: This NOTES.txt file uses Go templates, while deployment and service
manifests are rendered using JavaScript from the js-templates/ directory.
This demonstrates coexistence of both rendering methods!
